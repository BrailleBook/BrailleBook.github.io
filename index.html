            <h2 id='About Us'>About Us</h2>
            <p>Braille Book Organization for the blind is a nonprofit organization founded
            in August 2020. Our mission is to create positive change and make a difference
            in the lives of the visually impaired group. We dedicate ourselves to volunteer
            services such as Braille
            translation, blind tutoring, and blind offline guidance. Within 3 years, our
            organization has expanded to over 500 voluntary members. We have helped over
            50 visually impaired high school or college student complete their studies and
            translated over 150 textbooks, novels, or academic materials from English to
            Braille...</p>

            <h2 id="Our Services">Our Services</h2>
            <p>We provide a wide range of services. There are numerous ways to get involved.
            You can volunteer your time in translating books to Braille, connecting with
            local schools for the blind, tutoring visually impaired students who seek for
            academic guidance, or even learning Braille in your free time and reach those
            who need it most. <br>
            Our voluntary translation program translates books from English or other
            languages into Braille based on the needs or interests of the blind community
            we serve. Our volunteers are usually responsible for proofreading electronic
            scans of books in their original language. Then, our specialized Braille
            translators translate these electronic books into Braille and deliver them
            to the visually impaired community. Attempting to meet the needs of the
            entire blind community as much as possible, we translate a wide variety of
            books, including medical texts, textbooks, fictional novels, and more.</p>

            <p>Recently, we are developing an AI English-to-Braille Translator through the deep
            learning models. By taking a picture of some Braille texts, the AI translator
            is able to recognize each Braille character and match it to its corresponding
            English letter, or vise versa. We trained our translator through a dataset of
            Braille characters. Based on our initial model which could only recognize
            letters, we then constructed the secondary model to generate sentences and
            paragraphs from these letters. Braille has nothing different from other languages.
            We aspire to provide equal opportunities for Braille learners to get access to
            the globe.

            <p>We offer an online tutoring program for our visually impaired students.
            The students we serve range from high school students to graduate students. Based
            on the subject or course requirements for which they need help, the organization
            matches them with their corresponding tutors. We have helped multiple high students
            enter their dream colleges and college students pursue their future careers.

            There are times when our visually impaired population needs to travel, we
            provide them with transportation and guidance services. Our experienced volunteers usually
            would wait them at certain locations like bus or subway stations and escort the
            blind people to their destinations. Our volunteers show responsibility and care
            because they need to point out obstacles to the blind and understand them
            whenever they need help.
